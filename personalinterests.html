        <li>Activities</li>
        <p>To occupy me in my free time I like playing sports and doing outdoor activities for the most part. Living in a rural area with forests, mountains, and a lake to surround me, I had many opportunities. My favorite sports to play are soccer and golf. I also enjoy hiking and just exploring outside. </p>

        <li>Entertainment</li>
        <p>When I am not doing active things with my free time, I spend it watching movies and netflix. I have watched lots netflix series' including New Girl, Breaking Bad, and many more classics. Two of my other favorite shows are Westworld and Game of Thrones. I enjoy movies and shows that make you think. I have also seen many movies, and enjoy specifically ones that have major plot twists and make you think. A short list included Interstellar, Inception, Shutter Island, and many others. </p>
