        <li>Family</li>
        <p>I have a family of 5. My parents are Bette and Joe, both in their 50's. They are wonderful parents and did a great job raising my brothers and I. I have 2 brothers, Matt and Tony.
        Matt recently graduated from Colby College and is now living and working in Philadelphia. Tony is a financial analyst in Chicago, where he has lived since he graduated from the University of Maine in 2013. </p>

        <li>Hometown</li>
        <p>I am from a small town called Greenville, Maine. It is located in norther/central Maine, about an hour and a half north of Orono. It has a population of about 1,600 people, and is run by a tourism based economy. The main attraction is the large lake, Moosehead Lake and the massive ranges of undeveloped forests.
